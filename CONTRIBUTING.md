# Thinks to keep in mind

Maintaining the quality of contributions is essential to ensure the value and integrity of Hacktoberfest. While we encourage and welcome contributions from all participants, we also want to ensure that the contributions are meaningful and adhere to the principles of open source collaboration. To maintain quality and avoid spammy contributions, we have implemented certain guidelines:

## Quality Contributions

We value contributions that:
- Address real issues or feature requests.
- Follow the existing coding standards and project conventions.
- Are well-documented, including clear commit messages and code comments.
- Include tests when applicable.
- Enhance the overall functionality and usability of the project.

## Warning About Spammy Contributions

While we appreciate all contributions, we want to emphasize that Hacktoberfest is about quality, not quantity. Spammy contributions, such as creating a large number of trivial or unrelated pull requests, can be detrimental to the open-source community.

### Warning Process

If we identify spammy contributions, we will follow these steps:

1. **Warning:** We will reach out to the contributor through the pull request or issue to discuss the quality of their contributions and suggest improvements.

2. **Educational Resources:** We may provide resources or guidance on how to make meaningful contributions to the project.

3. **Ban: Warning:** If the contributor continues to submit spammy contributions without making an effort to improve, we may need to take more stringent actions.

### Banning from Hacktoberfest

In extreme cases where a contributor consistently submits spammy contributions without addressing the quality concerns, we may have to restrict their participation in Hacktoberfest. This step is not taken lightly and is done to maintain the integrity of the event and the open-source community.

## Our Goal

Our goal is to foster a positive and collaborative environment during Hacktoberfest. We encourage everyone to learn, grow, and make meaningful contributions to open-source projects. By following the guidelines and maintaining the quality of contributions, we ensure that Hacktoberfest remains a valuable experience for all participants.

Thank you for your understanding and commitment to the spirit of open source and Hacktoberfest. Together, we can make this event a success while upholding the values of quality and collaboration.
